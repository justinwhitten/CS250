How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are an interesting idea, they take the requirements from a client and simply lay them out in an easy to read manner, while providing a priority level for the development team. I think that the first part of this requries you to know your team and software, from there you can better determine for your client what you are capable of doing and what you are not able to do. Second, and perhaps the hardest, is determining priority levels for each task; this requires just experience as a product owner. This experience is what you really need to help interpret the users needs and get them implimented into whatever sort of software they want. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The most important process that I will need to incorporate is priorities and user stories as mentioned above. I believe that these things could benefit me greatly in future work, keeping me on track and towars a goal. Often I overthink things and a user story could help me clarify what I actually need to be implimenting without all the added bells and whistles.\

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I would say a good team member is one that knows there job, is willing to help others, and most importantly is will to take help when it is needed. I struggle with asking or taking help but I hope to one day change that.
